ConflictPlus Arma Reforger Mod

This mod is a spin on the conflict mode, that allows standard bases to be dynamically built by players, using the construction truck.
Conditions to build: must be > 600m away from any other placed or built base (friendly or enemy), and must be in friendly radio range.
To build a scenario, you can create a subscene of Everon_Base. This includes essential manager entities, and all you have to do is add MOBs and control points, and configure them correctly (as well ai/vehicle spawns optionally)
